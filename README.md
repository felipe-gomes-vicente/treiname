### üíª Treina Me

The challenge of this project was to fix bugs, web page that came broken and with 
errors, I strengthened my knowledge of HTML and CSS in applying concepts and what 
was seen in the previous project. 
I used figma when following the project prototype and solving the broken code.
I went further, challenged myself to apply concepts that were not seen in the 
Stage 1 and Stage 2 classes, CSS variables, CSS reset, typography import in the 
external CSS file and the organization structure of the project files.
